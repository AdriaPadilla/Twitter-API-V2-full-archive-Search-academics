### Important:

This repository has been deactivated due to technical changes and the restrictive policies imposed on access to the Twitter API, introduced by its current owner, Elon Musk, in 2022.

It is unacceptable that access to the Twitter API for academic research has been blocked, which appears to be a clear violation of the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA). This move not only undermines the rights of researchers and developers but also demonstrates Twitter's (now X.com) disregard for the rules that ensure transparency and accountability on digital platforms.

Under Musk’s leadership, Twitter has transformed into an opaque platform operating without any public oversight, enabling the unchecked proliferation of hate speech and disinformation. By ignoring European regulations, Twitter not only shows a blatant disrespect for international legal frameworks but also places itself in a legally precarious position, potentially facing sanctions.

The author of this repository has chosen to remove content that, besides being outdated, can no longer contribute meaningfully to public discourse due to the barriers imposed by the platform.

It is time to abandon Twitter. Continuing to create content for this social network is, in fact, supporting its business model—a model that perpetuates toxic practices and mechanisms that fuel disinformation, hate speech, and manipulation. Twitter has made it clear that its priority is not the public interest, but the consolidation of an information monopoly based on opacity and a lack of accountability.

Therefore, users are strongly encouraged to explore alternatives in free and open-source social networks, where control and transparency are not mere illusions but guaranteed rights. Let’s not be complicit in supporting a platform that turns its back on the common good in favor of private profit.
